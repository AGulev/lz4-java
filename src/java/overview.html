   <title>LZ4 - Java API</title>
</head>
<body>

<p><b>LZ4 - Java</b> is a Java port of the popular LZ4 compression algorithm. It
features two compression methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>fast scan</i>, a blazing fast compression method,</li>
<li><i>high compression</i>, a compression method that is slower but provides
better compression ratios.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases compressed data is very fast to uncompress. See the
{@link net.jpountz.lz4} package description for more information.</p>
