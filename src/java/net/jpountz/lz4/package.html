<p>LZ4 compression.</p>

<p>The entry point of the API is the {@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Factory} class,
which gives access to {@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Compressor compressors} and
{@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Decompressor decompressors}. This class has 3
instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>a {@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Factory#nativeInstance() native} instance, which
is a JNI binding to the C implementation of LZ4. This LZ4Factory instance is
expected to provide the fastests compressors and decompressors but the JNI
overhead might make it slower than the Java instances for short sequences.</li>
<li>a {@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Factory#safeInstance() safe} instance, which is
guaranteed to never segfault and throws exceptions instead.</li>
<li>an {@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Factory#unsafeInstance() unsafe} instance,
which leverages {@link sun.misc.Unsafe} to speed up compression and
decompression.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under doubt, you should use the safe instance, which is the only one that is
guaranteed to work with all JVMs and on all platforms. If interested in using
another instance, you should still use the safe instance as a fallback:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    LZ4Factory lz4Factory;
    try {
      lz4Factory = LZ4Factory.nativeInstance();
    } catch (Throwable t) {
      lz4Factory = LZ4Factory.safeInstance();
    }
</pre>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    LZ4Factory factory = LZ4Factory.safeInstance();

    byte[] data = "12345345234572".getBytes("UTF-8");
    final int decompressedLength = data.length;

    // compress data
    LZ4Compressor compressor = factory.fastCompressor();
    int maxCompressedLength = compressor.maxCompressedLength(data.length);
    byte[] compressed = new byte[maxCompressedLength];
    int compressedLength = compressor.compress(data, 0, data.length, compressed, 0, maxCompressedLength);

    // decompress data
    // - method 1: when the decompressed length is known
    LZ4Decompressor decompressor = factory.decompressor();
    byte[] restored = new byte[decompressedLength];
    int compressedLength2 = decompressor.decompress(compressed, 0, restored, 0, decompressedLength);
    // compressedLength == compressedLength2

    // - method 2: when the compressed length is known (a little slower)
    // the destination buffer needs to be over-sized
    LZ4UnknownSizeDecompressor decompressor2 = factory.unknwonSizeDecompressor();
    int decompressedLength2 = decompressor2.decompressUnknownSize(compressed, 0, compressedLength, restored, 0);
    // decompressedLength == decompressedLength2
</pre>
