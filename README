LZ4 Java
========

LZ4 compression for Java, based on Yann Collet's work available at
http://code.google.com/p/lz4/.

This repository contains three LZ4 compressor/uncompressor implementations:
 - a JNI binding,
 - a pure Java implementation,
 - a Java implementation that uses sun.misc.Unsafe to speedup
   compression/uncompression.

This repository is still experimental, don't use it (yet)!

Build
-----

Requirements
 - JDK version 6 or newer,
 - ant,
 - ant-cpp-tasks.

Then run `ant`. It will compile LZ4, LZ4 JNI bindings and LZ4 Java
implementations and generate a JAR file under the dist directory.
