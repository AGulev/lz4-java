LZ4 compression for Java.
http://code.google.com/p/lz4/

This repository contains three LZ4 compressor/uncompressor implementations:
 - a JNI binding,
 - a pure Java implementation,
 - a Java implementation that uses sun.misc.Unsafe to speedup compression/uncompression.

This repository is still experimental, don't use it!
